# Mystic Match!

## Inspiration
We were inspired to build this project around the idea of bringing a little magic to students while they navigate their lives in academia.

## What it does
We built a website to help UTD students find student organizations and clubs on campus

## How we built it
We used a combination of React, CSS, and Python.  CSS was used for the design model of the main page, while React was used to redirect and guide the user throughout the website and its activities.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team encountered obstacles on the back and front-end integration. Understand its responsibilities and what classifies as "specifically back-end". 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
There were many instances where we had to scrap the current concepts and think about what exactly we wanted to do, our determination to learn the dynamics and application of a complex program motivated us.

## What we learned
We've learned a lot about full-stack web development as well as how to efficiently work in a team under tight time constraints.

## What's next for Mystic Match: Enchanted to be Here
Mystic Match may be able to handle advanced matching algorithms in the future if more student organizations are added to the system in the future.
