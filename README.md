# Mystic Match!

## How to run it
In order to run this webiste on a localhost, you must have Node.js, including npm (node package manager), and the Mystic-Match.zip file. Then, extract the file, and use the following commands from your terminal of choice to boot up the localhost:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
npm install react-router-dom
cd my-app
npm start
```

If this does not work, it is likely that npm is not properly installed on your device. You can try reinstalling it by doing:


## Inspiration
We were inspired to build this project around the idea of bringing a little magic to students while they navigate their lives in academia. As freshman in engineering, it can be difficult to make new friends with similar interests. People always tell you to join clubs, but it can be overwhelming to look at so many options at once. We hoped to create a simple alternative that gives students instant match-making results, similar to dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, but for organizations!

## What it does
This website has students take a short quiz, then go through a list of recommended organizations and "swipe" yes or no (like a dating app!). At the end, they get a list of customized clubs they should look into joining.

## How we built it
We used a combination of React, CSS, and Python.  CSS was used for the design model of the main page, while React was used to redirect and guide the user throughout the website and its activities.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team encountered obstacles on the back and front-end integration. Understand its responsibilities and what classifies as "specifically back-end". 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
There were many instances where we had to scrap the current concepts and think about what exactly we wanted to do, our determination to learn the dynamics and application of a complex program motivated us.

## What we learned
We've learned a lot about full-stack web development as well as how to efficiently work in a team under tight time constraints. Most of us were unfamiliar with React going in, and we also go some experience with Streamlit in Python and MongoDB, although we didn't get the chance to fully implement either.

## What's next for Mystic Match: Enchanted to be Here
Mystic Match may be able to handle advanced matching algorithms in the future if more student organizations are added to the system using a database like MongoDB. In addition, we would love to add more universities and make this a statewide website so that more students can be helped!
